## Ticket #1: Ad Type Selection

- **Title:** Implement Ad Type Selection Interface
- **Project:** Skyscanner
- **Reporter:** Mark Lo
- **Description:**
  As a developer, I would like to implement an ad type selection page that allows users to choose between three ad formats: Text Ad, Image & Text Ad, and Video Ad. Each ad type should be displayed as a card with a distinct color and icon to clearly differentiate them. The cards should be reusable components.
  Please refer to the Figma design: https://www.figma.com/design/FDqEoj1lbmWYVOj5SsGdTs/Skyscanner-intern?node-id=0-1&p=f&t=nPniWTumPVIA1JSH-0 (Page 1 - Ad Types)

## Ticket #2: Analytics Dashboard

- **Title:** Build Analytics Dashboard for Ad Performance
- **Project:** Skyscanner
- **Reporter:** Mark Lo
- **Description:**
  As a developer, I would like to build an analytics dashboard that displays ad performance data. The left panel should list ad types (Text Ad, Video Ad) separated by horizontal dividers. The right panel should display a line chart visualizing performance metrics over time.
  Please refer to the Figma design: https://www.figma.com/design/FDqEoj1lbmWYVOj5SsGdTs/Skyscanner-intern?node-id=2-66&p=f&t=nPniWTumPVIA1JSH-0 (Analytics Dashboard page)

## Ticket #3: User Survey

- **Title:** Create User Experience Survey Page
- **Project:** Skyscanner
- **Reporter:** Mark Lo
- **Description:**
  As a developer, I would like to create a user survey page styled with Skyscanner branding. The page should include 5 questions with text input fields for user responses:
  1. How often do you use Skyscanner to search for flights?
  2. What feature do you find most useful?
  3. How would you rate the overall user experience? (1-5)
  4. What improvements would you like to see?
  5. Would you recommend Skyscanner to a friend?
  A blue "Submit" button should be placed at the bottom.
